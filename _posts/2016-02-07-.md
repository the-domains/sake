Living in Japan - I am extremely fortunate to experience the many facets of Japanese cuisine. But every so often "moments occur" ... moments that really slap you in the face ... like a curve ball ... and for last night I had one of those moments. Dinner at Nakajin in Kyoto. This was one of those truly mind blowing experiences ... The SAKE above is called Yorokobi no Izumi from Okayama.. the brewery no longer exists. The sake above had been ageing in Nakamura-san's fridge for 11 years .... something that is not really common at all. The rabbit hole goes deep with this one. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5092eba3-0e83-4a60-8b1c-79a177eef9d2.jpg)
