Sake Sumo. Welcome to SAKE
SUMO. 

Our mission is to provide (list) details of every sake brewery, sake
bar, restaurant, association and distributor on the PLANET and at the same time
create an online space where people can add events, articles and sake brewers
can promote their brand easily without having to pay big money for advertising.

Think of it as a centralized HUB for everything that is SAKE.

We started out
just wanting to list all the SAKE breweries in Japan in English, mainly for
people who visit Japan and want to visit Sake Breweries. Then we thought if we
do that, then we should really also list bars and restaraunts that have good
sake as well .... And then we thought -- well if we do Japan, we might as well
just do the whole world. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/304fd17f-ae51-4476-8d14-555f442adc7b.jpg)

So that is what we have started to do and will
continue until we are done. 

We developed the website to

GEO- Locate so that it provides information about SAKE places that are
closest to you. Of course you can search any country or city and the special map
feature lets you zoom in and work out exactly where you are looking.

If you have a business listing (breweries, businesses, bars etc) then
you can update your details, add a facebook feed, twitter feed, instagram feed,
youtube videos, your businesses website, contact details, menus and more! 

All of this can be controlled you're your own login
interface/ section. 

Also people can login and upload sake events for free - these can be
educational events, tastings, tours, parties, whatever!

And then we have added a section for articles about sake in various
languages (German, Italian etc - good for importers etc) - users can add these
themselves - but then they need to be approved (so we don't just have junk
uploading on the site)
