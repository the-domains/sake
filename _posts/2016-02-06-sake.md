# WELCOME

Welcome to the blog of [SAKESUMO.COM][0]

Here you will find general ramblings on not only sake but also Japanese food, culture and Japan in general. After all ...

_"A cuisine is a cultural expression and without some understanding both cuisine and culture are unappreciated."_

Due to this blog often being updated under the influence of the rice juice of the gods - you may find some slightly sideways streams of consciousness as we go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. 

Kanpai.
