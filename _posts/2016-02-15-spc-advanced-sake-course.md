What a rollercoaster of a week. We came, we learned, we saw and we pretty much conquered. 

The Sake Professional Level 2 Advanced Course was held in Tokyo (Nagano, Kanagawa, Shizuoka) from the 9th - 13th of Feb.  We learnt more than we could have imagined and drank about the same amount. Visited some amazing artisans and made some truly great friends. 

Special thanks to Masumi, Tensei and Kikuyoi and of course sensei John and Etsuko..
