Mt. Fuji aka Fuji-San - the view never gets old. It begins now really. On the train from Osaka to Tokyo ... It feels like it's already begun. Tonight we begin the looseness ... It's a catch up with the crew from last year ... We are off to a 1980's themed izakaya that has a great sake list. May the sake gods be with me.
